# The Webberman

There once was a place
to run your code

In us-east-I
on containerised Node

Requests came in,
replies were bestowed

From the lambda far away


Soon may the
server respond

To bring us markup
to look upon

One day when the
JavaScript runs

We'll take our page and go


The cold starts held
the data back

Till the Dane said
you should use JamStack

It sounded good
so we gave it a crack

For a while anyway


Soon may the
server respond

To bring us markup
to look upon

One day when the
JavaScript runs

We'll take our page and go


Static files are great,
unless

You need something
from the database

Then you'll need
to make a request

To chase the spinners away


Soon may the
server respond

To bring us markup
to look upon

One day when the
JavaScript runs

We'll take our page and go


If you don't want to
feetch() your data late

Just render your page
inside V8

Life on the edge is
pretty great

Friends, this is the way


Soon may the
server respond

To bring us markup
to look upon

One day when the
JavaScript runs

We'll take our page and go


Soon may the
server respond

To bring us markup
to look upon

One day when the
JavaScript runs

We'll take our page and go


Soon may the

To bring us markup
to look upon

One day when the
JavaScript runs

We'll take our page and go
